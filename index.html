          <p class = text-dark>A synopsis of international tourism data gathered from the data.un.org website; a production of the United Nations Statistics Division. From this data the focus is on the years of 2008-2018. The specific data that is focused on consists of: Non resident tourism arrivals by country, Resident tourism departures by country, and Non-resident tourism expenditures by country. 
            From this data four visualizations are presented to show: where the tourism hot-spots are in the world(bubble-map), which continents have the highest Non-resident tourist spending(stacked-bar), how arrivals have changed over the 11 years by country(line chart) and countries where the most tourists originate from(lollipop).  
            Some limitations to the data:  Expenditures, and arrivals and departures data do not take into consideration resident data.  For example a group of Data Visualization students traveling to Hawaii from Minnesota in Late August would not be counted in the data because MN and HI are both in United States. The expenditures in each country can not be completely accounted for due to differing payment methods and currencies. For example, a hotel stay in Tunisia might be payed for by a resident of the United States through a travel agency based in the UK and payed for in a previous year.  Also a person might spend a certain amount of untrackable cash in one country and bring some to another country via rental car.  
            Interesting finds from the study:  Most of the international tourism arrivals appear to be centered around three areas: US/Mexico/Caribbean, Western Europe/Mediterranean, and SE Asia.
            This is a group project for the University of Minnesota Data Visualization Bootcamp and was presented on July 20, 2020.  The group members are Emily Mobley, Kat Heron, Alynda Her and Jim Dale.
